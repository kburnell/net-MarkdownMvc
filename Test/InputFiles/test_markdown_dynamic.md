Hi, and welcome to the awesome that makes up That Conference.  This Family Handbook should have the answers you need to successfully navigate
the rapids leading up to and right on through the big event in August.  Even if you've been to That Conference before, things may have 
changed.  This Family Handbook is your best source for up-to-the-minute guides on what to do and where to go.  Check back periodically
for updates as well, as we'll be answering Frequently Asked Questions as they come up.

If for some reason, this guide does not answer a question you may have, here are a couple resources that you can use to get you out 
of the woods:

## Purchasing Tickets ##

We are, after all, a Big Tent conference, and we want you to know that your families are not only welcomed, but encouraged to join us for 
Junior Camper sessions.  Each family member requires their own ticket to That Conference; tickets can be purchased through the same link as the main conference tickets.
